# Project: World Billionaires Statistics (Excel Analysis)

In this project, I explored the top billionaires around the world by analyzing their personal, financial, and geographical data using Excel. The goal was to derive valuable insights into wealth distribution, gender ratios, sources of wealth, and economic factors that influence billionaire statistics globally.

## Tools & Techniques:

Pivot Tables: Used to summarize key metrics such as average billionaire wealth by country and gender distribution.

Charts: Created various charts like bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of wealth, the impact of Consumer Price Index (CPI) on wealth, and geographical distribution of billionaires.

Conditional Formatting: Highlighted data trends and outliers, such as the youngest billionaires or countries with high GDP but few billionaires.

Formulas: Utilized functions like AVERAGE(), COUNTIF(), and SUMIF() to analyze billionaire age, self-made wealth percentage, and more.

## Key Insights:

1.	Analyzed the average final worth of billionaires across different countries.
	
2.	Explored the gender distribution among the top 100 billionaires, visualized using pie charts.
	
3.	Examined the percentage of self-made billionaires vs. inherited wealth through pivot tables.
	
4.	Investigated the relationship between CPI and final worth in different countries.

5.	Identified the cities with the highest concentration of billionaires.

6.	Highlighted the countries with high GDP but a relatively low number of billionaires.
   
7.	Listed the top 5 youngest billionaires based on their age.
   
8.	Analyzed how the source of wealth varies among the top 10 richest billionaires.
   
### By leveraging Excel's powerful data analysis features like Pivot Tables and advanced charting, I was able to uncover trends and provide actionable insights regarding global billionaire data.
